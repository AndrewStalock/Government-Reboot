Lab-4-starter
=============

The starter code and tests for Lab 4: Traversing directories. This includes the starter code, tests, 
and the necessary CMockery include file (in ```include```) and library file (in ```lib```).

The primary goal of this lab is to gain some experience with (Unix) (file) system calls.

The CMockery files come from [building the library from Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/cmockery/) and were built
64-bit FC18 Linux boxes. If you want to use these tests on a different architecture you'll need to download and build
the library for your gear.
